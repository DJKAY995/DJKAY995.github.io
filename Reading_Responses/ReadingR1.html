		<h4>Kayla's Answers</h4>
		<ol>1. Just like the article said, crits are meant to be informational and give feedback on the work. I found that within my first two years at OCAD, crits were more gentle and nice.  I was less likely to give good feedback on how things could be risen up, added to or 'fixed' because I wanted to save the feelings of the creators; this was my major challenge through my years of schooling here. While I still have a bit of trouble bringing up things that could be amplified in crits or 'improved' upon, I find that within my third and going on fourth year at OCAD, that I'm less resistant to speak my mind and give informative feedback that would be beneficial to the creator. I changed my mindset from "I don't want to hurt their feelings" to "Give them a thought or a comment that they may not have thought about before and see where they could take that." I guess also a part of me is also nervous to hear more critical feedback on my work that I worked hard on.</ol>
		<ol>2. Whenever I get crits on my work that I don't agree with, I do one of three things. 1) I see what parts of it may work with my idea and concept. I try to figure out if something that was said was actually beneficial or not. 2) I say thank you for the comment and disregard it later on if I see that it won't improve the overall work or message I'm trying to send out. 3) I bounce off that person and see if there's a brainstormed idea that works off their comment and my overall idea.</ol>
		<ol>3. I think it's important to give crits ad get critiqued because it gives you a chance to get feedback from another person's point of view; ideas that you may not have considered are thrown out there and you're given tips on how to improve even further. I've had crits where someone made a comment, pointing out a different route for my project that I hadn't thought of and I ended up using some inspiration from them later on in my work. Again, just like the article said, when you gain good feedback, you feel empowered to keep creating and improving on your work. It's also a great way to gain inspiration for yourself based on other's work as the brief of a project can be interrupted in so many different ways.</ol>
