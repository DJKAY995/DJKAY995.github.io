		<h4> Discussion Question</h4>
		<ol>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</ol>
		<ol>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</ol>

		<h4>Kayla's Answers</h4>
		<ol>1. In her article, Seu asks the reader to defamiliarize ourselves with the tools of the internet; how the internet works and functions. I would interrupt this as removing oneself from what they know about the tools of the web in order to understand it from a different point of view; to push beyond the limits of creation. This would help the creative mind function and bring out of the box ideas. I’ve heard a lot of teachers start their lessons by saying “forget everything you know about ____ because you can’t learn more about something properly if you’re relying on past knowledge on the subject.” James Victore said a similar thing: “You can’t learn anything new until you are open enough to forget everything you think you know.” By ‘forgetting’ everything you know about the tools of the internet, you’ll be able to learn more about them; you’ll be able to create something more investing, more interactive, more pleasing to the eye, more fun. To push this point further, Seu write in her article that, in order to perform better on the interfaces we use daily, we must “[identify] the constraints of these tools [in order to] help us recognize their poetic potential…[which will inturn help us] identify these limitations and exploit them,” (Seu 2017). ‘Recognize their poetic potential’ meaning you’ll be able to gain the ability to push the web past its limits. So why use the word ‘poetry’? I believe that the word poetry was used because, just like the web and its tools, it has a rhythm. It has a beating heart that we can analyze over and over again. In school, we read Shakespeare so we can learn from the expert in order to write our own; we defamiliarize ourselves and learn his foregin language in order to grasp the concept of creating poetry so we can push our own writing past the limitations. So too, we learn about the tools of the internet in order to grasp the concept and push them past their limitations. Code can be considered poetry of the web; something that we can analyze, inspect, pull away from, poke, prodded, click, reload. Using the word poetry is bringing a sense of life to the tools we use.</ol>
		<ol>2. Removing Function from Form, one of Seu’s six categories within her taxonomy of tool poetic, is about using a tool outside its normal use and function. It is being removed from its original purpose in order to create something new and, sometimes, abstract. An example of this may be taking a mouse cursor and having it multiple everytime the screen is clicked. This would be removing the cursor from its original function of showing you where you are on the page, to an accumulation of chaotic black arrows making it harder and harder to see where you are on the page the more you click.  <a href="http://www.patience-is-a-virtue.org">http://www.patience-is-a-virtue.org</a> <----This website’s main page states “Loading, please wait.” This form’s function is to let the user know that the page is slowly loading and that they should be patient. This site removes the function from the form as the page never loads and the user will wait endlessly on the site waiting for nothing. “This website is all about testing your patience, but who would want to wait sitting on a website to load the page.”</ol>
