<p> 
	Coffee is something we are comfortable with; something that can be taken scorching or hot, lukewarm or just plain cold. A coffee can be forever varied; it can be taken black or changed by the whiteness of milk. It can be bitter or sweetened with the power of sugar and syrups. Coffee itself can be a savor, protecting us from the endless grip of sleepless nights or tired Monday mornings. Coffee, when done right, can be something discussed in friend groups. Coffee, when done wrong, can be something discussed in friend groups. A simple name spelt wrong can be posted online; an amazing blend can change a mood 180 degrees. A coffee to be made by a barista with a smile is nice, but a coffee made by your own hands is the best coffee of all.

	An individual website is something we are comfortable with; something that can be hot with drama or cold with facts; it is what we designed. An individual website can forever vary; it can change with the mood, the tides, the times, or the colors. It can be updated whenever and taken down whenever. An individual website can be a savor from endless grips of creative-less worlds or the tired droinings of scrolling down black and white pages of text. Websites, when done right, can be something discussed in friend groups; they leave experiences to share. Websites, when done wrong, can be something discussed in friend groups; they leave questions to be answered. A simple spelling mistake can be pointed out in seconds; the perfect design can create emotions for others. A website made by others can be filled out and tossed aside, but a website made by your own hands is the best website of all.
