		<h4> Discussion Question</h4>
			<ol>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </ol>
			<ol>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</ol>
			<ol>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</ol>

		<h4>Kayla's Answers</h4>
			<ol>1. It is expressed in the article that the word user is “no good” as it is thought to remind us of what once was; that there is a computer in front of us which does not allow us to think past the technology; it does not allow us to appreciate the experience we are gaining. Lianlina says that we should not try to remove this word - ‘user’ - from our vocabulary as it is what we are; people who use a computer. I agree with what Lianlina says, especially the part where she states that “it’s important to acknowledge that users existed…Users are the figment of the imagination,” (Lianlina) because without the user, computers, interfaces and technology would not have been thought up. Someone would need to actively use the computer in order to think up ideas to improve upon it, to expand it, to help it grow. As people, we are more likely to trust someone about a product if they’ve tried it themselves. If Steve Jobs had never used a computer in his life, when Apple came out people would have been more hesitant. But because of his background and the factor that he too is a user, people went for what he was selling. </ol>
			<ol>2. Lianlina coined the term “The General Purpose User,” which is her ideal internet user. To her this means someone who can do anything, figure out anything, and achieve anything on their own. They can be unapologetically themselves without needing to be anonymous. The General Purpose Users “can write an article in their email client, layout their business card in Excel and shave in front of a web cam. They can also find a way to publish photos online without flickr, tweet without twitter, like without facebook, make a black frame around pictures without instagram, remove a black frame from an instagram picture and even wake up at 7:00 without a “wake up at 7:00” app,” (Lianlina). To push it further, she seems to say that not only can the perfect internet user figure anything out about the web, but they can also figure things out without it. This can be made obvious when she states that they can wake up  at 7 in the morning without relying on an app to do it for them. The ideal user can find a balance in their lives with and without the internet. </ol>
			<ol>3. First thing that comes to mind when it comes to internet gaps being filled by users, is when users themselves post interactive situations for their followers and subscribers. On instagram you can ask your followers to answer questions and polls that a user themself would post. Same thing can be said about other apps as well. When advertisers are looking for help, they rely on the users to fill in the gaps through the internet for information and issues that need to be resolved. An example of that would be cultural appropriation in many advertisements (ex: Gucci designs, Fashion Week, Old Navy displays, Dove products) that were dealt with and taken care of through the users of Twitter and Facebook. The user’s input on these types of situations are valuable for the growth of others. The first example I stated get users interacting with on another and the second example gets the users’ opinions heard and mistakes eventually corrected.</ol>
