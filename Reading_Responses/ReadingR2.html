		<h4> Discussion Question</h4>
		<ol>1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</ol>
		<ol>2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</ol>
		<ol>3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</ol>

		<h4>Kayla's Answers</h4>
		<ol>1. When it comes to the two ideological camps, flat and skeuo, I think it depends on context when it comes to picking which to choose. Flat would be something I’d want to use when it comes to clean websites and put-together documents. I wouldn’t want something 3D or any textural elements to interfere with the information on the page; I wouldn’t want a website to look cluttered if it was an important one. If I was applying for a job as a doctor at a pristine hospital, I would go the flat route and make sure everything looked orderly, hoping that that would reflect on my character and work ethic. When it comes to a more interactive experience or a more creative outlook, I’d more likely go with Skeuomorphs. Frank Chimero described this camp as  “lickable buttons, realistic textures, folded paper, and stitched leather,” (2013). The sound of that comes off as more of a fun and interesting experience. This camp would be something I’d use for portfolios for more creative situations. They would showcase talent and skill (if they were created by the person) and may make it easier for visual people to see what’s being said over a flat drawing of something. Overall, I think it comes down to time and place with these two ideological camps as they’re both great when they’re used in the right context. </ol>
		<ol>2. Zoopraxiscope, which became the gateway for capturing motion in photography and eventually led to animation, is the process of capturing multiple pictures of a fleeting moment (capturing time itself). These photographs are then played in a rapid sequence in order to create movement. In short, it’s the beginning of creating moving pictures that could be played on repeat. Just like Zoopraxiscope, the web and interactive design relate as it also uses animation through illustrations and movements that help the user to navigate the web and its content. When we scroll through a page on a website, the animation of the screen goes up or down. This tells the user where they are on the web page and in what direction they’re going in; up or down; whether they’re at the start of the page or the end. This can be considered a movement of time. Not only that, Zoopraxiscope’s movement, when it comes to the web, allows designers and coders to create interactive designs for the users as well. When it comes to personalization, using more interactive movement and videos / GIFS (Graphics Interchange Format), can create a recognizable aesthetic and may even gear more users to your webpage because they can interact with it - there’s something fun and entertaining for them. I find that webpages with some movement grabs my attention more and may eventually lead me to continue searching the website to see what else is there. Another example of a medium that has inspired overall digital design and interactive movements on the web through frame changes would be the early Disney movies that were created through hand drawn images and laid down one after another to create the animation. This was the beginning of how stop-motion capture / animation could be used to create movies. Movies like The Jungle Book and Winnie the Pooh used the same hand drawn bases for some of their scenes because technology hadn’t changed enough for them to create individual scenes. Eventually, thanks to the creation of Zoopraxiscope, stop motion-capture would take a rapid turn and would be able to venture into claymation, something that Tim Burton, one of my favorite creatives / directors, loved. Claymation is the use of clay figures and sets that are filmed using stop-motion photography to create movement and videos / movies. A few examples of these types of movies would be Coraline, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Box Trolls, The Corpse Bride, Frankenweenie, Paranorman and Chicken Run. (These are all great movies and I recommend you watch all of them and more).</ol>
		<ol>3. “Flux is the capacity for [constant] change,” (Frank Chimero, 2013). Although it’s a hard question to answer, I agree that screens want flux and so do the people. Change is something people strive for; we want easier to access websites, simpler to understand applications, more personal and customizable websites, faster speed, more updates, better looks, upgraded cameras and features - all of which is constant change that technology and our devices need to keep up with. As the younger generation comes around, there's a need for (faster) change; a need for more advanced / interactive technology, web design, and animation. For example, Music.ly which was originally for lip syncing to quotes (usually from movies and popular videos on the internet) and song lyrics changed into TIktok, a younger version of the app; an app where there’s more interactive freedom to create scenes and overall content. This short video format, which originated on Vine, relates to the constant speed of change on topics and content. This style of constant change was replicated on Instagram (Reels) and on Youtube (Shorts). The need for consistent switches on the internet became a necessity as trends on the web pop up so rapidly and are short lived later on. </ol>
