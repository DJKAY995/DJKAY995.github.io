		<h4>Kayla's Answers</h4>
			<ol>1. Laurel Schwulst advocates for individuals to create websites of their own as opposed to social media accounts and pages because there are no limitations except for the imagination. She states that there “are endless possibilities as to what a website could be,” (Schwulst, 2018) and that when you put yourself, your everything into creating your own website, you start to form your own identity along with it (or at least get a better picture). She goes further to say that artists and their creativity can bring a better and more interactive experience to the web which is slowly being taken over by companies that create sites for the money and not for the people. Bluntly stating, “artists excel at creating worlds,” (Schwulst, 2018) and the World Wide Web is a world in itself. I agree with what Laurel Schwulst is saying because corporations have guidelines to abide by which leads the internet down a rabbit hole of uninteractive and stale web pages that, for the most part, lack the creativity that most users want in a site. With the way things are going in 2022 and the trend of running your own individual business, having your own made website not only helps you demonstrate what your brand is and the personality behind it,  but also allows you better creative freedom, something we need more of in a time where everyone has something to say. Why let your social media account stifle what you have to say? If larger branching companies like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter were the only ways for people to present himself online, we would have no uniqueness; no personality; no adventures. With individual websites, there is no social pressure for everything to be perfect as “[an individual’s] website can be anything…a website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished,” (Schwulst, 2018) and forever changing, just like people.  </ol>
