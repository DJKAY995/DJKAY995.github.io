                <h2>Phase 1: Traditional Designing</h2>
                <p>
                    For the first phase, I grabbed my sketchbook and start drafting a few typefaces in different grids and shapes. The first draft had been letters made from circles; the second draft had been letters made from sticks (inspired by Blair Witch); the third draft had been letters made from triangles. I really liked how the second draft came out so I moved onto the next phase...

                <h2>Phase 2: Digital Designing</h2>
                <p>
                    For this second phase, I began to digitalize my seond draft by using the Illistration application in Adobe. After that, I designed another font digitally; something inspired by a family favorite game: Mario!

                <h2>Phase 3: Start the Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    For this third phase, I began to code my Blair Witch typeface. After a few hours of trying to graph lines to cross over one another and a lovely chat with my Professor, I realized that, sadly, within the timeframe I had left, I wouldn't have time to finish the font. I resorted to plan B - use the second type I'd drafted in Illistration! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The creation of these letters was made by starting a graph that was than numbers accordingly. I then began filling in the squares that would make up my letters.

                <h2>Phase 4: Start the FUN</h2>
                <p>
                    For this fourth phase, I began to add in the fun qualities and elements: the animation! After searching far and wide for answers, I figured out how to make my text slide nicely. But it wasn't enough. I needed more. I thought about it overnight and woke up with a awesome idea: make it a seach and find game. I began coding away to hide some hidden skyblue backgrounds to some of the letters in order to make my font even more interactive. Instead of having one interactive element (hovering over the letter to make it move), I had two: hovering over to find the hidden colour!
