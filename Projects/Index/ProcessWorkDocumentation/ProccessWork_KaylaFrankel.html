                <h2>Phase 1: Research and Resources</h2>
                <p>
                   First I did some research to help me brainstorm my overall idea. I wanted something interactive and engaging, yet understandable and clear. After a while, I thought about doing a ‘hide n seek’ type game where the user would interact and become engaged by searching the page of tiny information in order to enlarge and find the information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The color I went with was blue because it’s psychologically calming. Over this project I felt a little stressed out so having this as the main color throughout all the assignments made me feel more relaxed when working on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The title typeface I went with is called 'Special Elite' from Google Fonts. I chose this one because I needed something more mysterious; something that gave me a ‘hide n seek’ vibe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later on, I began looking for resources (besides the amazing Peter) to help me work out the logistics and codes of my Index. Some resources helped me figure out how to make information grow, while others helped me find before and after buttons to add to other pages of the assignment. (Resources will be added below).

                <h2>Phase 2: Organization</h2>
                <p>
                   Phase two, I began focusing on organization. I’d gone through a few prototypes were one would have to search the blank page for all the tabs that would pop up, but after a while of thinking and sharing the preview with friends and family, I found that the information became too hard to find and would either jump to a random part of the page and get ‘lost’ or my family would lose interest in searching. Because of this, I decided to keep the overall information visible (to some extent) so the user would know there’s something there and that it’s their job to find out what it is.

                <h2>Phase 3: Start the Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    For the third phase, I began coding my website. The first steps I did was input my typeface I’d created and worked out the sizing, movement and color to make sure it a)looked good b)worked well and c)I was happy with. This was the simplest part of the project because it was mostly copying and pasting as well as a few codes being switched out to change the color. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next came editing the text into a nice hierarchy. I did this by changing typeface sizes, boldness and indents. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that came the more important information: the seminars. This part was a nightmare if I’m being honest. It took about two days to get the boxes and the overlays working right. It took another two tiring days to figure out how to get them to lay next to one another (the link below saved my life). Although I’m not 100% happy with how they look, I’m very proud of how they turned out as opposed to the beginning of those 4 days. (I guess when it says 24 hours, you really have to prepare to clock in - appreciate the heads up!)

                <p>
                     For the fourth phase, I began creating background colors to get my color scheme to look more consistent. It took me a while to figure out what shades of blue I wanted to use and how I wanted them to lay out.
