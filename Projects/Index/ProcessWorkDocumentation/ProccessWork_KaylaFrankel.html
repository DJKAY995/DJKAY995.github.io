                <h2>Phase 1: Research and Resources</h2>
                <p>
                   First I did some research to help me brainstorm my overall idea. I wanted something interactive and engaging, yet understandable and clear. After a while, I thought about doing a ‘hide n seek’ type game where the user would interact and become engaged by searching the page of tiny information in order to enlarge and find the information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The title typeface I went with is called 'Special Elite' from Google Fonts. I chose this one because I needed something more mysterious; something that gave me a ‘hide n seek’ / detective vibe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The color I went with was blue because it’s psychologically calming / security. Over this project I felt a little stressed out so having this as the main color throughout all the assignments made me feel more relaxed when working on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later on, I began looking for resources (besides the amazing Peter) to help me work out the logistics and codes of my Index. Some resources helped me figure out how to make information grow, while others helped me find before and after buttons to add to other pages of the assignment. (Resources will be added below).

                <h2>Phase 2: Organization</h2>
                <p>
                   Phase two, I began focusing on organization. I’d gone through a few prototypes were one would have to search the blank page for all the tabs that would pop up, but after a while of thinking and sharing the preview with friends and family, I found that the information became too hard to find and would either jump to a random part of the page and get ‘lost’ or my family would lose interest in searching. Because of this, I decided to keep the overall information visible (to some extent) so the user would know there’s something there and that it’s their job to find out what it is.

                <h2>Phase 3: Start the Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    The third phase and final phase was when I began my coding and minor edits along the way. I made sure all my other assignment pages were linked to the Index and functioning properly. There were a few twitches that I fixed in order to have everything look more coherent with one another. I did this by including that light blue from the Index into the rest of the assignments.
