                <h2>Phase 1: Brainstorming</h2>
                <p>
                    For this first phase, I started researching and brainstorming. With the subject of CURSOR, I began thinking about what it actually means to BE a cursor. Is it the fact that it points to things on a page so the user knows where they are; or is it the ability to click / select something on a page?  After having many thoughts over the span of many days, a brilliant concept leapt into my head: To do all of it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   In order to showcase the different funcations and abilities of the Cursor, I create a search and click abstract site. The instructions for the site are in blue: "Glide and Search then Click and Enlarge."  
                </p>

                <p>
                    GLIDE AND SEARCH: One will hover over different sections of the page to see the cursor differently. They'll see its different functions such as 'HELP' (a question mark), 'WAIT' (a blue spinning circle), 'NOT-ALLOWED' (a crossed-out mark), 'ZOOM-IN' (a magnifying glass), and 'GRAB' (a hand). Then, when they click anywhere on the screen, they'll see a box that will enla
                </p>

                <p>
                    THEN CLICK AND ENLARGE: One will click anywhere on the screen, which will trigger a box to appear. With every click, the box enlarges. This is meant to demonstrate the clicking abilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The secret function: if someone were to try and highlight the page, they'd see hidden messages that help the funcations to work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mind. Blown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And with that, I set to work creating a website

                <h2>Phase 2: Research</h2>
                <p>
                    For Phase 2, I started researching different colors and fonts to use. In the end, I kept to a default typeface because of its clarity and funcationabilty. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reason behind the color RED isn’t just because it’s my favorite colors but also due its physiological meaning. The color RED is linked with feelings like excitement and passion. It’s loud, playful and modern. It means speed as studies show that the color RED increases your heart rate, pulse and blood pressure just by looking at it.

                <p>
                    For this third phase, I began coding and working through all the hiccups I had, such as getting certain functions to work and figuring out how to connect everything to one another.

                    The main TINY issue…
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was meant to use this ( ` ) instead of this ( ‘ ). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Such a tiny detail caused me much stress. Thank god for the Inspect tool in Chrome that helped out with finding the issue in the end.

                   While, at times, this project was frustrating and hard to figure out, I’m happy with what I accomplished and how I was able to pull through during the harder parts.
