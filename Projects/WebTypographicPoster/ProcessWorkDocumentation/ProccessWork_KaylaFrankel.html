                <h2>Phase 1: Research</h2>
                <p>
                    After looking at the information package, I began my first phase. I went to the internet and did some searching into the brand, Museum of the Moving Image. I took note of the colors and typefaces they use as well as their website’s overall layout. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my first year of advertising, I’d recalled saying that the color blue usually stands for technology. I did a bit more research on that to discover that the colors red, blue and black together tend to mean stability, trust, advanced, security and technology which lead me to wanting this collection as my color scheme.

                <h2>Phase 2: Sketching and Digital Designing</h2>
                <p>
                    For the second phase, I grabbed a notebook and started brainstorming some ideas for layouts. Overall, I wasn’t happy with them because I couldn’t find a layout I both liked and knew I’d be able to achieve with my skills / amount of time left. After finding something that was decent, I went into Indesign and started drafting what the layout would look like, while also tweaking it along the way.

                <p>
                    The start and end of this stage were drastically different as I started figuring out what might be easier to do. (Boy was I wrong ahahahah ha ha *sigh*)

                <h2>Phase 3: Start the Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    For the third phase, I began coding my website. The first steps I did was input my typeface I’d created and worked out the sizing, movement and color to make sure it a)looked good b)worked well and c)I was happy with. This was the simplest part of the project because it was mostly copying and pasting as well as a few codes being switched out to change the color. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next came editing the text into a nice hierarchy. I did this by changing typeface sizes, boldness and indents. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that came the more important information: the seminars. This part was a nightmare if I’m being honest. It took about two days to get the boxes and the overlays working right. It took another two tiring days to figure out how to get them to lay next to one another (the link below saved my life). Although I’m not 100% happy with how they look, I’m very proud of how they turned out as opposed to the beginning of those 4 days. (I guess when it says 24 hours, you really have to prepare to clock in - appreciate the heads up!)

                <p>
                     For the fourth phase, I began creating background colors to get my color scheme to look more consistent. It took me a while to figure out what shades of blue I wanted to use and how I wanted them to lay out.

                <p>
                     Overall, I learned a lot from this project and realized that, for some things, I don’t need to look up how to plug them in as much. I’ve also realized that I’m faster at finding mistakes (except for the pesky periods). Although I'm not fully happy of the final project, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made from the start of this project and I’m happy to see that I’ve created something.
