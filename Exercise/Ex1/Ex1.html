			Hey hey everyone! My name is Kayla Frankel and I’m going into my 4th year of advertising.
		</p>

		<p>
			This website takes prompts that you’ve written and, based on the style you pick and what you wrote, AI will create a piece of art work for you. 
		</p>

		<p>
			
			The prompt I wrote, which is listed below the AI’s art work, is a list of what my overall striking features are: My blonde curly hair, my red lipstick that I always put on before leaving the house (even under the mask) , my blue eyes, and a smile that I frequently wear.
		</p>

		<p>
			This was the result…
		</p>

		<p>
			I tried a few different styles and ended up going with a Van Gogh aesthetic, not just because it was one of the better looking portraits but also because I find his overall work to be striking and on the more interesting side of art due to its textural look. The shape of the face is also a staple of how Van Gogh would paint his own portraits.
		</p>

		<p>
			What I love about this self-portrait and what speaks to me the most about it, is that it isn’t perfect - just like me. There are features that are more exaggerated (the eyes, the eyebrows, the lips) which definitely relates back to my style of art: more abstract and ‘weird’.
