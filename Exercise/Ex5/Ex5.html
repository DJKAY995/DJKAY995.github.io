			In this assignment we're meant to inspect a New channel's website and change their information to fit our own. In order to make it more athletic about me, I created a short headline about something I would do - get banned from a chocolate place for diving into their facilities head first. To keep my personality going within this piece, I spelt things wrong on purpose as everyone who contacts me knows; I can’t spell to save my life (and if I was writing for the news, I’d be fired on the spot).
